                        <h1>Convention votes for economic democracy and housing justice</h1>
                        <p class="smallblockcapstitles"> 2 November 2012</p>
                        <p>Sam Coates, male co-chair said:</p>
<p>"I'm really pleased that we've voted to put these two issues centre stage. The toxic cocktail of high youth unemployment and lack of access to decent, affordable housing is affecting so many young people and the policy we passed in Sheffield is a response that fits the bill."</p>
<p>The full papers are below.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 class="pageTitle">Towards Economic Democracy</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>This policy paper was passed at Young Greens Convention 2012 in Sheffield. The original text is adapted from articles by Peter Tatchel.</p>
<p>Currently most economic decision-making is concentrated in the hands of a tiny, privileged cabal of major shareholders, directors and managers. Whatever people think of the current economic system, one thing is indisputable: it is characterised by an absence of democracy, participation, transparency and accountability. Employees and their representative bodies - the trade unions - are frozen out of economic influence and decision-making.</p>
<p>It is time to bring the economy into democratic alignment with the political system. Extending the economic franchise is about democracy and justice. It can help create a greater plurality and diversity of economic power, and also lay the foundations for a more equitable and productive economic partnership between all those who contribute to wealth creation and to the provision of public and private services.<span style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6em;"> </span></p>
<p>There are several ways in which we could begin this structural democratisation and cooperativisation of the economy. We propose to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asserting and retaining public control of the banks that were rescued by the government, to ensure that they operate in the public interest and use their future profits for the public good. Retaining public control or remutualising the banks could be the means to fund new social housing and low-interest loans to poorer families; as well as a means to finance employee-owned cooperative enterprises.</li>
<li>Make corporate negligence and recklessness an explicit criminal offence, to reign in big business sharks and ensure more responsible economic management. Bankers and company bosses should not be able to wreck whole economies and squander with impunity people’s jobs, pensions and savings. They ought to be personally liable for damaging corporate decisions, in the same way that doctors and others can be held liable for professional negligence. The threat of legal penalties is likely to result in more prudent corporate governance.</li>
<li>Legally limit corporate bonuses to a weighted percentage taken from a minimum of 4 years future profit. This could be payable in a combination of shares, money and paid leave (with a minimum of 20% each). If the individual has left the organisation, they will be paid their leave's worth at salary rate, of the year in question. This would deter short-term, high-risk investments. It would make bonuses conditional on a business’s long term success. Only people who made successful, sustainable investment decisions would be rewarded. There should be no automatic bonuses.</li>
<li>Implement a system of industrial democracy which would require the boards of all public and private enterprises with 50 or more employees to establish equal representation and joint control between management and elected staff representatives. Under an independent chairperson acceptable to both sides, these boards would have full access to all corporate information and the final say over all corporate decisions, including investment, technology, wages, prices and so on. Although imperfect, this system of co-determination would produce a major extension in workplace democracy. It would shift the balance of economic power; constraining the remit of capital and expanding the influence of labour; forging a more co-equal partnership. It would also be good for the economy because worker directors would offer independent oversight of corporate operations and bring to the boardroom practical, often cost-saving, insights from their direct day-to-day experience. Not motivated by the profit motive and private gain, they would be more likely to blow the whistle on reckless risk-taking and on decisions that damage the consumer and the environment.</li>
<li>Enable trade union, in combination with the state, control of pension funds. This could be accomplished by legislatively re-assigning the administration of pension fund assets to potential experts appointed by, and accountable to, individual trade unions, as well as the state, who would act as trustees of the funds on behalf of their members all across the country. Or, alternatively the funds could be placed in the hands of a regional union pension funds, overlooked by the state, acting for all the trade unions and their members in a particular region. This would localise and decentralise investment capital. It could then direct these funds in to specific enterprises corresponding to the interests of union members and to broader social needs, such as the development of renewable energy and conversion of arms industries to socially useful civilian manufacture. The states co-regulation would ensure diversification of investment while preventing self interest.</li>
<li><a name="_GoBack"></a>Give employees the legal right to buy-out their companies and turn them into workers cooperatives contingent on them following green and ethical policies. Buy outs could be funded with loans from publicly-controlled banks. This would weaken the power of big corporations, localise and socialise economic decision-making and give employees incentives for greater productivity. Evidence shows that people employed in workers cooperatives often have higher output, better job satisfaction and stronger social solidarity.</li>
<li>Progressively transfer share ownership into trade union-administered employee share funds. This would obligate all private share capital companies to assign to a union-controlled fund a proportion of their annual profits in the form of a new share issue. This would gradually, over many decades, give employees, through their unions, a controlling interest in their firms - transforming them into self-governing workers’ co-operatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to traditional reformist economic doctrines of Keynesianism and Welfare Statism, which merely seek to redistribute wealth more fairly within the confines of the existing free market, private ownership, bosses-rule system, these ideas for economic democracy are mechanisms for the structural transformation of capitalism. If implemented, they would alter, fundamentally, the distribution of wealth and power, in favour of organised labour and working people.</p>
<p>A new left revival requires new thinking. We need to make the left relevant again by offering both radical and practical solutions to the economic crisis – a crisis that has arisen, in large part, from concentrated and unaccountable economic power. This means challenging the system of economic dictatorship and setting out a new model of economic participation, accountability, decentralisation and transparency. The interests of employees, consumers and the wider public welfare demand it. The time for economic democracy is now.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1 class="pageTitle">Housing Policy</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Young people are facing massive challenges with housing. Access to housing for young people in all sectors is collapsing. This means young people are staying at home far longer than before, and substantially restricts their freedom to make choices to shape their lives.</p>
<p>Part of this problem is due to the rising price of housing in the private sector and a lack of new social housing. Similarly, the impact of the credit crunch means that it is more difficult for young people to own housing, which has been the goal of Labour and Conservative governments for the past 30 years.</p>
<p>Unemployment and benefits cuts to those in and out of work mean that those with housing are finding it difficult to afford to stay there. With youth unemployment (16-24) at over 1 million (20%) and housing benefit being systematically cut, the current generation is falling into a deep housing crisis.</p>
<p>Prior to the financial crisis and recession, young people were expected to move into private rented housing and from there into more secure social housing or to buy their own home. Young Greens believe that housing is a right and that access to quality, affordable, and secure housing can best me met through a more balanced mix of housing than present.</p>
<p>The role of housing and of the reckless promotion and financing of home ownership through sub-prime mortgages is well known. The UK has one of the highest proportions of ownership (69% )after Greece (93%), Spain (86%), and Ireland (73%). Whereas Denmark, Sweden and Germany have a more or less similar proportion of rented and owned housing (approx. 40%).</p>
<p>As Young Greens, we also believe that all housing should be brought up to decent standards. This means that new housing should be built to high environmental standards, which would mean lower fuel costs and better health for tenants. This principle should also be extended into existing private rented housing, by setting higher and rising standards and government investing in improvement.</p>
<p>A more sustainable and just housing deal for young people could be achieved with the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oppose the Welfare Reform Bill and the cutting of housing benefit to under 25s, many of whom have dependent children. These changes will increase youth homelessness and restrict access to housing</li>
<li>Oppose massive subsidies directed towards encouraging home ownership. Support a more balanced and stable housing sector by building new social council and cooperative housing</li>
<li>Protect private tenants by regulating lettings agents, and the rents they charge. Shelter have recently proposed the creation of a stable rent contract which would control rents, and we endorse this proposal.</li>
<li>Protect existing social housing by ending the right to buy, opposing deregulation of social housing, and the privatisation of Housing Associations.</li>
<li>Repeal the criminalisation of squatting – homeless people should not be criminalised if adequate housing cannot be provided through social security.</li>
<li>Raise the energy standards of new build homes and extend the Decent Homes Standard into private rented housing and fund improvements.</li>
<li>We would levy extra taxes on empty homes, and encourage those who are under-occupying housing to transition into more suitable housing.</li>
<li>Repeal reduced tenure for new social housing contracts as passed under 2011 Localism act. Oppose the bedroom tax.</li>
</ul>
<p>The role of activism in housing is crucial. The Young Greens aim to get involved in campaigns to improve housing locally and nationally. This could be in the form of setting up new campaign groups in local areas or supporting existing struggles. The Young Greens are committed to campaigning for socially just and environmentally sustainable housing inside and outside of parliament.</p>
