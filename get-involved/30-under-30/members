                        <h1>The first 15</h1>
                        <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span><strong>The first 15 - a quick peek</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>We have now selected 15 people to begin the scheme this year and will be recruiting again later this year. Below is a quick biography the 30ers so far:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Josiah Mortimer</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Hi, I'm Josiah. I've been a member of the Green Party for nearly a year after leaving the Labour Party and have never looked back! I realised that the Greens are the only party advocating a real alternative to cuts, war and inequality. I'm currently finishing my first year studying Politics at the University of York, where I'm treasurer of the Green Party society. We've worked hard at York to engage students disillusioned by the three main parties. My main areas of interest in Green activism are putting forward our economic alternative wherever possible and not retreating to our environmental comfort zone. I'm also passionate about building our base in the North and among working-class people.</span></p>
<p><span>My main interests outside of politics (heaven forbid!) are listening to Radio 4, drinking tea, folk music and reading the paper (you can guess which one!).</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Sam Hollick</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Sam has recently finished a degree in Physics and is now a city councillor in Oxford. He is interested in building local parties, and communicating Green politics on making the economy work for people not profit.</span></p>
<p><span>His background is in campaigning for democratic reform, and against fees, cuts and the NHS sell off, largely in a university context.</span></p>
<p><span>Outside of politics, Sam spends his time growing food, brewing wine and cooking.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lewis Coyne</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Born and brought up in Liverpool, Lewis has just finished his first year of studying International Politics at City University in Islington. He joined the Green Party in November 2010 after being impressed by its radical but responsible policies and its principles of social justice.</span></p>
<p><span>Since joining, Lewis has acted as election agent for 2011 local elections in Liverpool, as well as managing the target campaign there. He is ambitious for the Green Party to rapidly become more electorally successful and is particularly looking forward to helping with the London local and European elections in 2014.</span></p>
<p><span>Lewis is a keen cyclist and lapsed violinist. As a Scouser, he has special skills in conflict resolution. He enjoys a good twitter argument: @LewisCoyne</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lisa Camps</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Hi, I’m Lisa!  I’m Cornish born and bred, but am currently studying Social and Political Sciences at the University of York, where I’m the chair of the Green Party society.  I joined the Greens last year as I felt completely disillusioned by the other parties.  I can honestly say that I’ve never had a second to doubt my decision and I feel so at home in the party, and really believe in the principles at our core.</span></p>
<p><span>I enjoy reading, knitting, aerobics and cycling.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Laurie W</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Laurie works on policy and research for the Green Party. His enthusiasm for Green politics comes from the Green Party's core values of compassion, democracy and sustainability and  its radical, credible and increasingly popular alternative to conventional politics. He decided to  apply for 30 Under 30 having had a great time supporting the Greens' 2011 Brighton and Hove local election campaign.</span><span> Whenever he can find the time, Laurie enjoys playing guitar, swing dancing and sustainable travel. Having focused</span><span> his </span><span><span>MSc in Environmental Technology </span>dissertation on value priorities in energy policymaking, Laurie is keen to help the Party benefit from applying values theory to its politics and policy development.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Joella Lynch</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I'm from Sunderland originally and have been involved with the Green Party for a little under 2 years. I joined the Green Party because I believe in their values of equality and environmental sustainability and felt a need to start being involved with a group of people working towards positive change. I Studied Astrophysics at Edinburgh University and have recently finished a MSc in Disaster Management and Sustainable Development at Northumbria University. 'Ive just moved to Oxford to start working at Oxfam and in my spare time I enjoy reading, running, yoga and attempting to cook vegan food!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Rosie Dammers</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Rosie studies history at Manchester University. She is chair of the Manchester Young Greens society and is committed to creating a fairer, greener society.</span></p>
<p><span>In her spare time Rosie enjoys playing the banjo, vegan cooking in the nude and taking her pet ferret Willam for walks in the local park. Currently Rosie is learning to belly dance and play the tambourine. She is in no doubt that her hobbies will not only increase her employability, but will also equip her with all the skills she will need when the revolution comes.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Siobhan MacMahon</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Siobhan recently graduated with a Masters in Politics. She has a strong interest in the issues surrounding social inequality, and is training to become a CAB Adviser.</span></p>
<p><span>Was a founding member and secretary of the The University of Sheffield Green Party Society as well as being a long time campaigner for the Sheffield Green Party.</span></p>
<p><span>Outside of politics she enjoys playing roller derby, vegetable growing and foraging, but never all at once!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Charlene Concepcion</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Charlene has a BA in Politics and an MA in Social and Global Justice from the University of Nottingham. Since graduating she has worked with various NGOs and charities. Charlene is interested in political theory, social movements and trying to get more people engaged with politics."</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Fiona Ferguson</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Fee comes from a media and communications background and has a particular interest in countering</span><span>political disengagement and widening the appeal of Green politics. She has a Bachelor of Arts </span><span>in Journalism and Human Rights, and is now finalising research for a Master of Arts in Political</span><span>Communication from the University of Leeds.</span></p>
<p><span>Fee is currently living in Edinburgh and in her spare time enjoys the gym, kickboxing, reading, fashion</span><span>and being a domestic goddess. Her favourite things in life are socialising, meeting new people and</span><span>making new friends.</span></p>
<p><span>Twitter: @feeferg</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Alfie van den Bos</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Alfie is Secretary of the campus party at the University of York where, aside from helping organise</span><span>debates, planning weird and wonderful pub adventures and writing articles, he studies history and</span><span>politics. Known to many as the “fastest pun-slinger in the west” and “Attila the Pun”, Alfie is</span><span>renowned for his witty weekly emails that have fans from across the political spectrum. On a more</span><span>serious note, his favourite policy areas are media regulation, educational reform and foreign policy, </span><span>and he especially takes an interest in dealing with the philosophical basis of the party.</span></p>
<p><span>Elsewhere </span><span>Alfie enjoys video games, real ale and the French Revolution. Perhaps most importantly he owns a </span><span>George Monbiot T-shirt, though he acknowledges that Monbiot has become a bit of a twit in recent </span><span>times.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Elliot Folan</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Elliot Folan is an 18-year old student in London who is about to start University. He helped run the Yes to AV campaign in his local borough, served on his local youth board and stood as a candidate for the UK Youth Parliament. When not occupying banks or getting out the vote in elections, Elliot is a graphic designer and enjoys video g</span><span>ames.</span></p>
